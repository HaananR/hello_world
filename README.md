What's Up Codees!

The name's Haanan :-) and I love getting to know what goes on behind the scenes with applications. You know like how: those pop up menus that show themselves when you hover over some text in the navigation menu on a web page; an app that is able to translate touch gestures on a smartphone into actions performed by the app; and how software is able to function on an OS. As of right now I am currently practing web page design (which is pretty cool!).
